Welcome to Neptune— the farthest planet from the sun. This icy planet is named after the Roman god of the sea. Neptune’s deep blue color comes from its atmosphere of methane gas, which allows blue light to be reflected. Like Uranus, Neptune is made of ice and gas. 


During the 1990s, in the southern hemisphere of Neptune raged the Great Dark Spot, a rotating storm with winds greater than on any other planet with wind speeds of up to 1,500 miles per hour. The storm has since dissipated but Neptune is continuously developing new storms all across the planet. Powerful winds are more common here than on any other planet, with some winds 9 times stronger than the most powerful winds on Earth, and 3 times stronger than on Jupiter.


Neptune has a collection of a few small rings and 14 known moons. One of its moons, Triton, is the only large moon in the solar system to orbit opposite the way the planet rotates, indicating it was once an independent object that got captured by Neptune’s gravity.


Neptune, unlike most other planets, is so far away that it was unknown to ancient humans. It was discovered in the mid-1800s using observations of Uranus’s orbit and math to calculate where an eight planet must be.


This cobalt planet, farthest from the sun, is a dangerous yet fascinating member of the solar system.
