Welcome to Saturn - the sixth planet from the Sun, and the second biggest planet in the Solar System. It is made up of almost entirely hydrogen and helium gas; scientists speculate that the humongous volume of gas surrounds a small rocky core, although it has not been confirmed. Saturn has 10.7 hour days, but it takes 29 Earth years to complete a full rotation around the sun. 


The most impressive part of Saturn are its rings, which are made up of ice and dust. These rings give Saturn one of the most unique looks in the solar system. Saturn has eight distinct rings, and they are thought to have come from pieces of comets, asteroids, or shattered moons that broke up before reaching the planet.


Saturn has 146 moons in its orbit, the highest number in the solar system. Some of its satellites are planet sized, while others are shaped like potatoes and ravioli. These moons are all intriguing and unique worlds; ranging from the haze-shrouded surface of Titan, to the crater-riddled Phoebe. There are many amazing things to still discover about Saturn.
