Welcome to the Psyche asteroid, one of millions of asteroids in the asteroid belt. Unlike the asteroid belt’s depiction in popular culture, this sector of the solar system is rather empty. If you were to fly through the asteroid belt, it would require astronomical luck to run into a single asteroid. Today, you have arrived at one in particular: the Psyche asteroid. And what a fascinating asteroid it is.


Unlike more common asteroids, made of rock or ice, Psyche is the solar system’s largest known metal asteroid. It’s so large that some scientists believe that Psyche was the core of a planetoid forming in the early solar system whose outer rocky layer got knocked off in collisions. 


This brilliant, metallic asteroid will be receiving a visit in two-thousand and twenty-nine. The NASA Psyche mission launched an unmanned spacecraft in October of two-thousand and twenty-three which will be used to research this asteroid. The spacecraft is equipped with a variety of scientific instruments which will give scientists an understanding into what this metallic asteroid is like. Scientists are hoping that, if Psyche is an exposed planetary core, it can give us insight into what our own core is like.
