Jupiter, named for the king of the gods, dominates the solar system at an imposing 1,321 times the volume of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Jupiter would be the enormous size of a basketball. This massive planet is the first, and largest, of our solar system’s gas giants, which are a collection of planets made almost entirely of gas and, at lower depths, liquid. 


Jupiter’s striped and swirling appearance is caused by its composition and spin. Jupiter spins at a much faster rate than Earth, with a day on Jupiter only lasting 10 Earth hours. This rapid spin, as well as other factors, cause the gaseous layer of Jupiter to separate into stripes. The light-colored stripes are caused by a thicker layer of water and ammonia clouds. The darker bands have thinner and darker clouds.


Jupiter’s most iconic feature, The Great Red Spot, is a whirling wind storm that houses winds up to speeds of 250 miles per hour. With a width of 10,000 miles, The Great Red Spot could easily engulf the entire Earth. 


Jupiter’s gargantuan size has allowed it to capture 80 to 95 moons— the most of any planet in the solar system. One of the largest moons, Europa, is one of the most likely locations in the solar system to sustain life. In addition to moons, Jupiter has rings formed from orbiting dust, though they are rather difficult to see unless backlit by the sun.


Jupiter, with its massive scale and dominating beauty, seems fit to be named for the king of gods.
