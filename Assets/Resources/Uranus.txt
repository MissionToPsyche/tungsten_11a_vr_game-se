The beautiful, blue planet of Uranus is named after the Roman god of the sky. It gets its pale, marine color from the methane in its atmosphere, which allows the blue and green light to be reflected. 


Like Neptune, Uranus is mostly made of different types of slushy ice, earning it the term “ice giant.” As with all four non-terrestrial planets, if a spacecraft were to fly into the atmosphere of Uranus, not only would it be impossible to find a solid surface to land on, the spacecraft would be crushed, melted, or vaporized by the extreme pressures and temperatures.


Completely unlike every other planet in the solar system, Uranus spins on its side, with an axial tilt of 98 degrees. When Uranus orbits the sun, it appears to roll along, like a ball would. This strange tilt causes extreme, years-long seasons on the planet. Also because of the tilt, Uranus’s rings and 27 moons orbit perpendicular to the way they do on most other planets.


When Uranus was first discovered in 1781, the discoverer tried to name the planet something completely different: Georgium Sidus, after his sponsor, King George the Third. This name was met with opposition from many other astronomers. After the name Uranus was suggested, it gained traction, eventually becoming the official term for the planet.


Uranus, a cosmic enigma with its captivating blue hues and unique axial tilt, defies convention among planets. This cosmic gem remains a celestial mystery, intriguing astronomers and scientists with its perplexing nature.
