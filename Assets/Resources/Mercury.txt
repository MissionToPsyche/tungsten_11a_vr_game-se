Welcome to Mercury– the planet closest to the sun. Aptly named after the Messenger God, the planet Mercury zips around the sun at a ferocious pace. This planet orbits the sun over 4 times faster than Earth. In fact, a year on Mercury is only a swift 88 Earth days long. In addition to having a short year, Mercury itself is rather small. At only slightly larger than Earth’s moon, Mercury is the smallest of all the planets in the solar system. Unlike all the other planets, save for Venus, Mercury does not have a moon. 


Pockmarked with craters and a flat grayish-brown color, the surface of Mercury looks quite a bit like Earth’s moon. The most striking feature of Mercury to a visitor could very well be the sun. It would appear 3 times larger on the surface than the sun appears on Earth and be 11 times as bright. During the day, temperatures can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit. And due to not having an atmosphere, the temperature drops to a frigid minus 290 degrees at night. 


A day on Mercury takes a very long time, especially in relation to how long its years are. A day on Mercury is 59 Earth days and its years only a little bit longer, at 88 days. Because of this odd orbital ratio, double sunrises can occur, where the sun rises above the horizon, falls back down below, and then appears above the horizon again. This can also occur in reverse with sunsets. Despite being inhospitable to humans, with extreme temperatures and intense solar radiation, at least Mercury has a beautiful sunrise.
