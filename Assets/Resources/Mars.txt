Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, and Earth's neighbor, is a world of captivating mystery. Its reddish hues give the appearance of a celestial jewel, though don’t be satisfied by only its alluring topography. Amidst the rusty terrain lies a world of intrigue.  Despite its resemblance to a garnet desert, in the deep past, Mars contained some prospects of life. Water once flowed freely, as evident in the dry riverbeds and polar ice caps. Could life, even in its simplest forms, have lived on Mars? Currently, the Mars exploration program has made it one of their goals to determine if Mars ever supported life.
Mars, like Earth, is a terrestrial planet and one stained red by the soil’s rusted iron oxide. The Martian surface is a rugged, barren landscape, bearing the marks of ancient river valleys and towering volcanoes. It is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons. 
The thin, wispy atmosphere of Mars is unable to accommodate humans. It lacks oxygen and harbors frigid temperatures, with an average of minus 80 degrees fahrenheit. The sun, though distant, casts a warm glow, warming the temperatures in the day to as high as 70 degrees. The Martian day is just a bit longer than one on Earth, but the Martian year is nearly twice as long as Earth’s. 
Mars, named for the Roman god of war, beckons humanity with the allure of exploration and the promise of unfolding its mysteries. It may not be an inviting garden, but it is a place of endless fascination and discovery.
