Welcome to Earth – the third planet from the sun. Named simply after the ground, it is the only planet in the solar system to not be named after a Roman deity. The Earth takes 365 days plus 6 hours to complete a full rotation around the sun.


Earth is a water planet, with 71% of its surface being covered by water. Water is essential for life, we use fresh water for electricity, farming, and sustaining ecosystems. Evidence points to oceans on other planets, but Earth is the only planet in the solar system to have consistent, stable bodies of liquid water in the solar system.


Earth has a single satellite called the Moon, theorized to have been created when a Mars-sized object collided with Earth billions of years ago. People did not know of the existence of other moons until Galileo discovered four moons orbiting around Jupiter, which is why our moon is simply called “the Moon.”


Earth’s sustainability is in great danger, its main threat is the continuous burning of fossil fuels, which are increasing the amount of greenhouse gasses that trap heat inside of the atmosphere. The rising temperatures are disrupting algal blooms, melting glaciers, and causing mass extinction for many species of animals and plants.


Being the only planet hospitable to humans in the solar system, it is our responsibility to take care of it so that we may keep enjoying its natural beauty and wonder for generations to come.
