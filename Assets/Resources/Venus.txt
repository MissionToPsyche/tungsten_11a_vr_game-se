Venus— the second planet from the Sun is unlike anything else in the solar system. With a thick, cream colored atmosphere this Earth-sized planet looks calm and inviting. In reality, it is anything but that. 


While it is a terrestrial planet like Earth, Mars, and Mercury, Venus is uniquely covered in a dense atmosphere, changing its appearance and trapping heat from the sun inside. Under the yellowish-white clouds is a surface scattered with volcanoes, rocky peaks and valleys. Its alien landscape is covered in strange geologic features, many of which formed from melting rock or volcanic activity. Temperatures are hotter on Venus than on any other planet, even Mercury, which is closer to the sun. The surface temperature on Venus is so blazingly hot that lead melts.


The sun in the Venus sky would look like just a bright smear through the viscous atmosphere. The sun would also rise in the west and set in the east, although very, very slowly. With a single day lasting two hundred and forty-three earth days, Venus’s day is actually longer than its two hundred and twenty five day year!


Named by ancient astronomers after the Roman goddess of passion, this planet, with its blazing heat, dangerous climate, yet striking beauty might just be aptly named.
